Flagpole Installation Standards 
 
 
18. Flagpole installation: Flagpoles have been approved in Murrayhill in the past. In reviewing a flagpole installation 
application the ARC’s primary concern is to protect the rights of other Murrayhill owners.  To this end the ARC 
considers the impact the flagpole will have on scenic Views of other lots, how the flagpole will appear from other 
lots, the noise the flagpole may create, and considers the density of flagpoles already in the neighborhood. 
In addition to considering the impact the flagpole will have on neighbors, the ARC considers the Quality of the 
Material comprising the flagpole, the installation of the flagpole, and the landscaping immediately surrounding the 
flagpole. 
Flagpole height may not exceed 20 feet.  Flag sizes are relative to flagpole height. (See table below). Flags must be 
maintained in good condition. 
 
1. A “cut sheet” showing what the pole looks like and how it’s constructed. ARC wants to make sure the pole is 
well made and won’t become an eyesore in a couple of years. 
2. Details of how will pole be installed. 
3. A scaled drawing of the lot showing: 
 a.     the placement of the pole on the lot; 
b. the landscaping that will be installed around the pole. 
       4.    Lighting for the flagpole, if any.  Flagpole lighting is just another instance of outdoor lighting and the   
       ARC must review and approve all outdoor lighting applications.  If no lighting is requested the ARC  
       will make   “no lighting” a condition of approval. 
 
5.    Size of the flags flown.  Flag size should be relative to flagpole height. The table below shows. The
